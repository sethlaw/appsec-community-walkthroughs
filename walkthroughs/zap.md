# Application Security Community Walkthrough

## Zap
[Zap](https://www.zaproxy.org/) is a Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tool for web applications.  It allows for both scripted and interactive scanning.

Zap was originally an [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) project.  It is currently in transition to be part of the [Software Security Project](https://softwaresecurityproject.org/blog/welcoming-zap-to-the-software-security-project/)

### Starting up
when you start ZAP you will get a screen like this:

For now let's not persist our session:

This will leave you on the home screen:

We will be going over "Manual Explore" more in a different walkthrough.
