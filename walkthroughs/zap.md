# Application Security Community Walkthrough

## Zap
[Zap](https://www.zaproxy.org/) is a Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tool for web applications.  It allows for both scripted and interactive scanning.

Zap was originally an [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) project.  When Checkmarx [hired all of the lead developers](https://www.zaproxy.org/blog/2024-09-24-zap-has-joined-forces-with-checkmarx/) it has been rebranded "ZAP by Checkmarx".

### Installing
You can download ZAP from [www.zaproxy.org](www.zaproxy.org) and requires Java 11 or higer to run.

### Starting up
When you start ZAP you will get a screen like this:

For now let's not persist our session:

This will leave you on the home screen:

We will be going over "Manual Explore" more in a different walkthrough.
